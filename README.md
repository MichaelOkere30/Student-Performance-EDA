# Student-Performance-EDA
This analysis uses a student performance dataset containing demographic details, study habits, attendance records, and subject scores. Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to examine data distributions and relationships between student characteristics and academic outcomes.
## Dataset
- Source: [k](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- File: `student_performance.csv`
- Contains student demographic information, study habits, attendance metrics, and subject scores in Mathematics, Science, and English.

## Notebook
- `student_performance_eda.ipynb`: Includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and analytical insights.

## Key Findings
- Higher attendance and increased study hours are associated with improved academic performance.
- Internet access shows no clear link to higher overall scores—students with and without it perform similarly.
- Math, Science, and English scores are strongly connected: good performance in one usually means good performance in the others.
- Parental education level has little to no effect on student scores in this dataset.
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
